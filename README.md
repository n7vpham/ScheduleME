# ScheduleME

**Note**: This project was developed for ITSC 3155 – Software Engineering. It was my first experience working on a team, using Git branches and pull requests, and building a full-stack application from scratch. While the implementation is minimal and unpolished, it marked a key milestone in my journey into collaborative software engineering.

## 🗓️ Project Management

We used a GitHub **Project Board** to manage features, track tasks, and coordinate work across the team. This gave us hands-on experience with Agile-style collaboration.
